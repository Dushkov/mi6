      ## About X-Team

      X-Team is a company with many unique positive aspects. We're (most of us) working on remote from all parts of the world on varying projects such as X-Factor, 24, American Idol, X-Team.com, Fox.com etc.

      With developers all over the globe there's a rare and very useful positive side effect - there's always someone working. When one worker's day ends, another one's begin which means our projects benefit greatly from never being delayed.

      Being a part of X-Team is a great honor. The atmosphere, leadership, sense of responsibility and community - it's breathtaking.
