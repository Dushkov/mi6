  Two years work of the Redbet platform was done before this new requirement came up - theming. The Whitebet project was theming on a stick, the platform had no out-of-the-box support for running different themes so a great project was initiated, to split up user databases yet to keep some areas shared across the various brands.

  The Front-End was a great challenge in terms of design, scalability and performance friendly solutions, caching, theme/brand-specific assets&features.
