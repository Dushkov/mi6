Summary: Backbone.js being one of my favorite MV* frameworks will be my approach to a new project I'm starting.

# Adding a backbone to the portfolio

Working with backbone.js is something that has re-ignited my passion for javascript projects greatly. The MV* approach to building rich client side applications really clicked for me, however I haven't had the opportunity to dive into a backbone project with my day-2-day tasks so I've decided to start it up off-hours.

I'll be sharing the progress on github and an example of it in-action on a miphe subdomain.
