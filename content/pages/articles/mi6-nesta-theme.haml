  It's a minimalistic and responsive theme for the Ruby CMS [Nesta](http://nestacms.com), built on Sinatra. Nesta is a CMS for developers and designers who likes to write articles and other content in Markdown/Textile or similar formatting languages. No database, no login, no admin area - write content, commit, push.

  The theme is under development still and improvements are added frequently, including behavior for smaller devices. I'm also trying to keep the /docs area up to date where you can read exactly how to use the features this theme offers.

  Contributers are welcome!
