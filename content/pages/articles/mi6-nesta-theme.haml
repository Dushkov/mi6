:markdown
  I built a new theme for my portfolio/dev-blog/anything -site and thought it might be useful to someone else. It's now [available on Github](https://github.com/miphe/mi6.theme).

  It's a minimalistic and responsive theme for the Ruby CMS [Nesta](http://nestacms.com), built on Sinatra. It's a CMS for developers and designers who likes to write articles and other content in Markdown/Textile or similar formatting languages. No database, no login, no admin area - write content, commit, push.

  The theme is under development still and improvements are added frequently. I'm also trying to keep the /docs area up to date where you can read exactly how to use the features this theme offers.
